\subsection{\label{subsec:life}Life Time \& Performance Degradation}

Since the spacecraft will go through different regions of space, we need to ensure that it will be able to sustain the interactions with the diverse environments that will encounter. Without much loss of its performance so that it would not produce significant measurements. In this chapter, the conclusions from evaluating the simulation of the mission using SPENVIS will be shown. In particular the ones used to determine the amount of shielding necessary both for the solar arrays and the memory device, and the the likelihood of single even upsets on the spacecraft's memory.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{subsec:shield}Total Dose \& Shielding}
\subsubsection{Solar array shielding}

Using SPENVIS, we simulated the mission with the spacecraft with the Azur 3G28 as the solar panels used by Willzyx I. The shielding of the solar panels is made of a lager of glass ($SiO_2$). The design requirement is that the output power ($P_{max}$) of the solar panels stay above 95\% after the duration of the mission.

\caption{Electron equivalent flux spectra for varying depths of Silicon}
\label{eqflux}
\end{figure}



After a few iterations we conclude that the layer of glass over the solar arrays must be about 65\,$\mu m$ thick in order to have a degradation just 3.75\% from their initial value, This complies with the design requirement. The reason for the very small thickness of the shielding is because of the time of the mission, we simulated the trajectory over 1 day, and this was enough to see the spacecraft even the outermost radiation belts. This means that the time spent in the harsh radiation and plasma environments surrounding Earth will not induce major damage to the solar arrays with the proposed shielding thickness. In addition, this thickness of shielding would only increase the mass of the solar panels by $0.172 kg\,m^{-2} $ which is acceptable for a space mission.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Memory shielding}

In order to run the necessary software for controlling the systems of the spacecraft, a memory device is needed. This is assumed to be made of Silicon (Si) and have a protective shielding made of aluminium at 1mm thick. It is also stated that the memory device can receive 100\, krad of radiation before it stops working. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/SiShielding.png}
\caption{Total received radiation dose at different aluminium thickness}
\label{SiShielding}
\end{figure}

This was also simulated with SPENVIS. The resulting radiation is shown in figure \ref{SiShielding}. The toal radiation received by the memory device is 1.57\,krad, well below the operating limit of the memory. With this we can conclude that the shielding of the memory is sufficient for the proposed mission.

%	SINGLE EVENT UPSETS (Elrick).
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{subsec:SEU}Single Event Upsets}
A single event upset (or bit flip) happens when radiations strikes the electronics on the PCB of the spacecraft. It can then ionize a couple of atoms in a (field effective) transistor which can cause a current to flow. This current causes the so called single event effects, of which the most common one is called a single event upset (SEU). This happens when the current is low enough to not burn the components (then it would be a single event burnout) but high enough to flip a bit in a memory device and thus corrupt the data stored. In order to have less SEU the memory should be shielded and/ or a redundancy computer can be implemented that compares memory. In the latter case the data should be stored on different memory devices using a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) protocol.\\

In table \ref{tab:SEU} the most important parameters for the TTL and CMOS chips are shown. It can be seen that the CMOS chip is larger, uses less energy but has a longer delay. The most important parameter for the SEU is the noise margin. This is for the CMOS chip higher than for the TTL chip. This means that a larger offset for a single bit must be given before the data is corrupted. In applications where power and data protection is key, the CMOS chip is a better solution. This is for instance the case in spacecrafts.

%	LET-SPECTRUM (Elrick).
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\subsection{\label{subsec:let}Linear Energy Transfer (LET) Spectrum}
To estimate the SEU rate, firstly the LET spectrum has to be estimated. Using SPENVIS the plot in figure \ref{fig:LET-shielding} has been made. Here it has been taken into account that there is an effective shielding of 1\,g/cm$^2$. If aluminum is used with a density of 2.7\,g/cm$^3$, then the shielding thickness is 0.37\,cm. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figures/LET-shielding.png}
\caption{Differential and Integrated flux of ions from hydrogen to uranium, as a function of the linear energy transfer (LET), with an effective shielding of 1\,g/cm$^2$, shielding tickness of 0.37\,cm with aluminium. The volume is 38.7\,x\,38.7\,x\,2\,$\mu$m \cite{SPENVIS}.}
\label{fig:LET-shielding}
\end{figure}

The integral representation of the SEU rate $\dv{U}{t}$ is given by equation \ref{eq:LET}. Here $\sigma$ is the experimentally determined cross section of a device as a function of LET and angles $(\theta,\phi)$. $h$(LET) is the differential fluxes of ions as functions of LET, summed over all relevant ion species (also called the LET spectrum).

\begin{equation}
\dv{U}{t} = \int^{2 \pi}_0 \int^\pi_0 \sin{\theta} \int^{\infty}_0 \sigma(\text{LET}, \theta, \phi) \cdot \sum^{92}_{Z=1} h(\text{LET}) d(\text{LET}) \,d\theta\,d\phi \label{eq:LET}
\end{equation}

The first two integrals in equation \ref{eq:LET} can be simplified to $4 \pi$. Thus the equation can be simplified to equation \ref{eq:LET2}.
\begin{equation}
\dv{U}{t} = 4 \pi \int^{\infty}_0 \sigma(\text{LET}, \theta, \phi) \cdot \sum^{92}_{Z=1} h(\text{LET}) d(\text{LET})\label{eq:LET2}
\end{equation}

The size chosen is 38.7\,x\,38.7\,x\,2\,$\mu$m. This means that, in the worst case scenario without taking into account the spacecraft charging ($\phi$), the cross section $\sigma$ is 1.5\,nm$^2$. However, for this example the cross section is ignored $\sigma = 1$. The differential flux summed over the elements H (hydrogen) to U (uranium) $\sum^{92}_{Z=1} h(\text{LET})$ is given as the straight line in figure \ref{fig:LET-shielding}.\\

When integrating over the differential flux and multiplying this result by 4$\pi$, as done in the MATLAB program in appendix \ref{app:matlab:LET}, the figure \ref{fig:matlab:LET-shielding} is obtained. Here the blue and red line are the original data, obtained from SPENVIS. The yellow line is the integrated flux by hand over the differential flux from SPENVIS. It can be seen that it doesn't quite match the integral flux from SPENVIS. This can be explained that SPENVIS re-calculates it's integral data to get a better precision. This means that it takes more data into account for bigger values of LET, which it does not provide to the user. This explains the difference on the right hand side. The difference on the left hand side can be explained by a difference method to determine the effectiveness of the shielding. Shielding mostly blocks the particles with a lower amount of energy.

%	CROSS SECTION \& COMPONENTS CHARACTERISTICS (Elrick).
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{subsec:CSCC}Cross Section and Components Characteristics}
For some components the  characteristics are known are given. For this mission the SMJ329C50GFAM66 chip is used, this chip only has direct measurements available, as shown in table \ref{tab:SMJ-LET}. To find the cross section and the sensitivity of this chip, a Weibull function has to be fitted to the this data.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Ion & Energy Beam & Flux particles & Exposure time & Flips \\
& [MeV] & [cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$] & [minutes] & \\\hline

$^{84}$Kr & 84 & $7 \cdot 10^6$ & 10 & 21022\\\hline
$^{131}$Xe & 786 & $4 \cdot 10^6$ & 15 & 18043\\\hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{SMJ329C50GFAM66 chip measurements}
\label{tab:SMJ-LET}
\end{table}

Dividing the energy of the beam in table \ref{tab:SMJ-LET} with the ion number the LET stopping power can be read from figure \ref{fig:LET-stoppingpower}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/stoppingPower.png}
\caption{CREME Stopping Powers in Silicon.}
\label{fig:LET-stoppingpower}
\end{figure}

The cross section ($\sigma$) in cm$^2$ can be calculated from equation \ref{eq:sigma}. Here the N is the number of flips, F the flux of the particles in cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and t the exposure time in seconds.
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{N}{F \cdot t} \label{eq:sigma}
\end{equation}

When plotting the cross section to the LET stopping power, it can be seen that there is a LET threshold ($L_0$) around 4.5\,MeV\,cm$^2$\,mg$^{-1}$, in figure \ref{fig:matlab:LET-sigma}. It can also be seen that the saturated cross section ($C_s$) is approximately $5 \cdot 10^{-6}$\,m$^2$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{data/sigma/L0.eps}
\caption{LET Threshold ($L_0$) is around 4.5\,MeV\,cm$^2$\,mg$^{-1}$ and saturated cross section ($C_s$) of $5 \cdot 10^{-6}$\,m$^2$, calculated using appendix \ref{app:matlab:sigma} for the SMJ chip.}
\label{fig:matlab:LET-sigma}
\end{figure}

With the same range of fluxes from figure \ref{fig:LET-shielding} and the known threshold LET and saturated cross section, the curve can now be fitted using the Weibull function. The equation that is used for the fitting is shown in equation \ref{eq:weibull}. Here $L$ is the LET, $L_0$ is the LET threshold, $C_s$ is the saturated cross section, $W$ the distribution weight [MeV\,cm$^2$\,mg$^{-1}$] and s an experimentally determined shape parameter. This is done in figure \ref{fig:matlab:LET-sigma-all}. In this figure also the chips NMOS2164, CMOS-R160-25 and Bipolar 93L422 are shown. The parameters for these chips are shown in table \ref{tab:all-LET}.
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\text{LET}) = \begin{cases}0 & , L < L_0 \\ C_s \left( 1- e^{-\left( \frac{L - L_)}{W}\right)} \right)^s & L \geq L_0 \end{cases} \label{eq:weibull}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{subsec:SEU-esti}Single Event Upsets Estimation}
The Single Event Upsets can be estimated using equation \ref{eq:LET2}, which is again shown below in equation \ref{eq:LET2-2}. The differential flux summed over the elements H (hydrogen) to U (uranium) $\sum^{92}_{Z=1} h(\text{LET})$ can be obtained from SPENVIS and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:LET-shielding}. The cross section based on the LET value is calculated in appendix \ref{app:matlab:sigma}. Calculating the total bit flips on average per day are shown in table \ref{tab:SEU-estimation}, together with the values that can be obtained from SPENVIS. It can be seen that the CMOS has the lowest amount of single event upsets and is thus the best choice.
\begin{equation}
\dv{U}{t} = 4 \pi \int^{\infty}_0 \sigma(\text{LET}, \theta, \phi) \cdot \sum^{92}_{Z=1} h(\text{LET}) d(\text{LET})\label{eq:LET2-2}
